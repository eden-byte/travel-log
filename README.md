# 🗺️ My Semester Abroad Travel Map

> *"I can't draw, but I can code."* - A digital alternative to a traditional travel scrapbook

## 📖 The Story

After spending an incredible semester abroad exploring Europe, I wanted a way to preserve and share my memories. While others might create beautiful hand-drawn scrapbooks, I decided to build something that matched my skills - an interactive travel map that brings my journey to life through code.

This full-stack application transforms my travel experiences into an interactive visual story, plotting each destination on a map with photos, memories, and ratings.

## ✨ Features

- **📍 Interactive Map**: Click on any pin to explore memories from that location
- **📸 Photo Integration**: Each location includes photos from the trip
- **⭐ Personal Ratings**: Rate each destination (1-10 scale)
- **📝 Travel Notes**: Add comments and descriptions for each place
- **📅 Visit Dates**: Track when each adventure happened
- **➕ Add New Memories**: Double-click anywhere on the map to add a new entry
- **🎨 Visual Design**: Clean, modern interface with custom markers
